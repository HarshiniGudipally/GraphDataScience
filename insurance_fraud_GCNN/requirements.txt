requirements for the fraud detection project using Graph Neural Networks, here's the command to install all the necessary packages:
text
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio pandas matplotlib scikit-learn torch-geometric torch-scatter torch-sparse torch-cluster torch-spline-conv

This command will install:
PyTorch and its related packages (torch, torchvision, torchaudio)
Pandas for data manipulation
Matplotlib for plotting (if needed)
Scikit-learn for preprocessing and model evaluation
PyTorch Geometric and its dependencies (torch-geometric, torch-scatter, torch-sparse, torch-cluster, torch-spline-conv)
Please note that the specific versions of torch-geometric and its dependencies should match your PyTorch version and CUDA version (if you're using GPU). The command above doesn't specify versions, so it will install the latest compatible versions.
If you need specific versions or have a particular CUDA version, you might need to modify the command. For example, if you're using PyTorch 1.10.0 with CUDA 11.3, you could use:
text
pip install torch==1.10.0+cu113 torchvision==0.11.1+cu113 torchaudio==0.10.0+cu113 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113/torch_stable.html
pip install torch-geometric torch-scatter torch-sparse torch-cluster torch-spline-conv -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-1.10.0+cu113.html
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

After running these commands, all required packages for the fraud detection project should be installed and ready to use.
